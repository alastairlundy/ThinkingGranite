License: Apache License, Version 2.0

You may use, modify, and distribute this model in accordance with the terms of that license.

To help others understand your model’s lineage:

- If you create and distribute a derivative of a Granite model, as a best practice, start the new model’s name with your identity, then a descriptor of your derivative model, and finishing with the full name of the Granite model (e.g. acme/reasoning/Granite-3.3.8B-Instruct). 

- Include the full model name (e.g., Granite-3.3-8B-Instruct) in documentation or metadata.

- Avoid using "Granite" alone in your project title to prevent confusion with official IBM releases.
